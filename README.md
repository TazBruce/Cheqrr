# PartPlanner

A PC part management dashboard for builders

## Product Specification

### The Idea

A digital platform for users to manage the inventory of their pc parts and understand the costs that are put into
creating an overall build.

### What makes us different?

Instead of focusing on finding PC parts, this solution focuses on the insight and management of existing ones.

### Who are our competitors?

PCPartpicker

### How can we win?

PCPartPicker has support for managing existing PC parts, however, it is extremely bare and doesn’t provide a useful
insight into a user’s budgeting and planning of builds. This leads flippers and tech enthusiasts to typically use
software such as Excel or Google Sheets to make up for this problem.

PCPartPicker is superior in its ability to analyse a build’s compatibility, however, if we ignore this factor and focus
rather from an inventory management perspective, we could meet an unfilled gap in the market.
